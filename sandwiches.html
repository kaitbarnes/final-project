                               <LI><B>Brown Chuck Roast Steak:</B> Heat up Instant Pot using Sauté More function. Wait until it says HOT (~8 mins). Pat dry the chuck roast steak and lightly season one side with salt + black pepper. Drizzle the inner pot with 1 tbsp olive oil. Then, place the seasoned side of chuck roast in Instant Pot. Lightly season the other side with more salt + black pepper. <br>
                               <U>Pro Tip:</U> Brown each side for 10 minutes to develop some awesome deep flavors.</LI> 
                               
                               <LI><B>Saute Onion & Garlic:</b> Set browned chuck roast aside. Add in sliced onions, then saute until softened (~3 - 4 mins). Set aside roughly ⅓ of the softened onions for later. Add in minced garlic, a pinch of dried rosemary, a pinch of thyme, and 2 bay leaves. Saute for another minute. <br>
                               <U>*Pro Tip:</U> Your Instant Pot will stop sauteeing after 30 minutes, turn it back on by pressing "Saute" button.</LI>
                               
                               <LI>
                               <b>Deglaze Instant Pot:</b> Pour 1 cup unsalted stock in Instant Pot, then deglaze by scrubbing all the flavorful brown bits off the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon.</LI>
                               
                               <LI>
                               <B>Pressure Cook Chuck Roast:</b> Add in 1 tbsp (15ml) soy sauce, 1 tbsp (15ml) fish sauce, and 1 tbsp (15ml) Worcestershire sauce. Give it a quick mix. Place browned chuck roast back in Instant Pot and partially submerge it into the liquid as best as you can. Pressure Cook at High Pressure for 45 minutes + 25 minutes Natural Release.</LI>
                               
                               <LI>

                               Simmer Au Jus Sauce & Shred Beef:</b>
                               Set aside chuck roast in a mixing bowl, and shred the beef with 2 forks. While you are shredding the beef, bring Au Jus sauce back to a boil with the "Saute" function. Add in reserved onions, then let the Au Jus sauce reduce for 5 - 10 minutes. Taste & adjust seasoning accordingly. <br>
                               <U>
                               *Pro Tip:</U> Reducing the Au Jus sauce will naturally thicken it. If you find the Au Jus sauce to be too oily, you can use a Fat Separator to filter out the fat.
                               <LI>
                               <B>Assemble & Serve Instant Pot French Dip:</b> <U>Optional Step:</U> While the Au Jus sauce is reducing, preheat oven to 350°F. Layer 1 loaf of french bread with slices of Swiss cheese on top. Place it in the oven until the cheese begins to melt. 
                               Layer shredded beef and onions on top of the sandwich. Serve Instant Pot French Dip with savory umami Au Jus sauce on the side.</LI></ul></div>

                  <h2>Philly Cheesesteak Recipe</h2> <P>
                    <B>Servings:</b> 2 sandwiches<br>
                    <B>Total time to cook:</b> 3-4 hours of thawing meat, around 1 hour of cooking time<P>
                    <B>Ingredients</b>
                    <UL>
                    <li>
                    1 large (1 to 1-1/2 pound) thick-cut rib-eye steak
                    Neutral cooking oil, such as canola</li>
                    <LI>1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped
                    Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper (some people use Lawry’s salt, or add garlic powder)</li> 
                    <LI>4 to 6 slices provolone or American cheese (or warmed Cheez Whiz)</LI> 
                    <LI>2 large hoagie or sub rolls, split open</li>
                    </ul> 
                    
                    <B>Cooking Instructions</B>
                    <ol> 
                    <LI>Place the rib-eye in the freezer and chill until semi-firm (not frozen solid), about three to four hours. Cut the steak into 4 smaller pieces. Working with one piece at a time — while leaving the rest in the freezer — use a mandolin or a sharp chef’s knife to slice the steak into razor-thin slivers. (If using a mandolin, I recommend investing in a cut-resistant glove.) Transfer the sliced meat to a medium bowl and set aside. Alternately, you can ask your grocer's butcher to do this for you if they have a meat slicer. If they agree, it will make life easy-peasy for you! (<Br>
                    <u>Pro-Tip:</U> I keep all of the fat. Every last bit of it. It’s why you bought a rib-eye in the first place).</li> 
                    <LI>Heat a large cast iron griddle, skillet, or other large pan over medium heat. Add a liberal pour of neutral oil, about 2 to 3 tablespoons, and add the onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 3 to 6 minutes depending on desired doneness. (Make sure you are patient with this step!) Once the onions are done, push them aside (or transfer to another bowl if there's not enough space).</li> 
                    <LI>Increase heat to medium-high and add another drizzle of oil if the griddle seems dry. Season the shaved rib-eye pieces generously with salt and pepper and add to the sizzling skillet. Cook the meat until browned and caramelized, which should happen quickly if the pan is smoking-hot. If you are cooking on a griddle or flat top, push the cooked steak into two separate piles and shape into roughly the same size as the hoagie roll. Shingle two to three slices of cheese over each stack of meat, allowing the cheese to melt while the meat is resting. (Alternately, you can transfer the meat to a separate plate to rest).</lI>
                    <LI>While the meat is resting, place the hoagie rolls flat-side down on the griddle and cook until lightly toasted. Using a large, flat spatula, gently scoop the meat and cheese mixture and transfer it into the hoagie roll. Slice in half crosswise and serve immediately.</li>
                    <LI> 
                    <u>Final pro-tip</u>
                    If you have bell peppers or mushrooms in your fridge, slice those thinly and cook them once the onions are done. French fries also go well with this meal!</li>
