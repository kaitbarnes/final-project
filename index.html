      <P><h1>Hello, we're Kyle and Kait!</h1></P>    
    <p>We are a couple of nerds living in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Kentucky" target="new">Northern Kentucky</a> where we raise two spoiled black cats, binge watch too many horror and action movies, stan UC Bearcats basketball, and enjoy eating... a lot. Kyle is the primary chef in our household and is famous among our friends and family for his delicious and elaborate meals. If you're visiting this website, there's a good chance you've requested one of Kyle's recipes and were sent here instead. The purpose of this website is to showcase Kyle's best recipes and serve as a repository for the millions of meals Kyle has and will make for our little family.</p>
